therapeutic strategies of stage II/III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients after curative surgery remain controversial. In the clinical decision-making process, oncologists need to answer questions such as whether adjuvant chemotherapy is necessary or which therapeutic regimen should be given to each patient. At present, whether adjuvant chemotherapy should be applied is primarily based on histopathological features and clinical risk factors. However, only a fraction of patients can benefit from it. More rigorous stratifying biomarkers are urgently needed to help further distinguishing these populations of patients. Recent progress in next-generation sequencing and high-throughput technologies has greatly promoted biomarker discovery as well as our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in CRC. Novel genetic and epigenetic biomarkers that are associated with prognosis or therapeutic responses have emerged.

Variants affecting RNA modifications that play critical roles in many aspects of RNA metabolism have recently been linked to many human diseases, such as cancers. Evaluating the effect of genetic variants on RNA modifications will provide a new perspective for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of human diseases. Previously, we developed a database called ‘m6AVar’ to host variants associated with m6A, one of the most prevalent RNA modifications in eukaryotes. To host all RNA modification (RM)-associated variants, here we present an updated version of m6AVar renamed RMVar (http://rmvar.renlab.org). In this update, RMVar contains 1 678 126 RM-associated variants for 9 kinds of RNA modifications, namely m6A, m6Am, m1A, pseudouridine, m5C, m5U, 2′-O-Me, A-to-I and m7G, at three confidence levels. Moreover, RBP binding regions, miRNA targets, splicing events and circRNAs were integrated to assist investigations of the effects of RM-associated variants on posttranscriptional regulation. In addition, disease-related information was integrated from ClinVar and other genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate the relationship between RM-associated variants and diseases. We expect that RMVar may boost further functional studies on genetic variants affecting RNA modifications.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"RMVar: an updated database of functional variants involved in RNA modifications","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations.\nHigh-throughput sequencing technology is rapidly becoming the standard method for measuring gene expression at the transcriptional level. One of the main goals of such work is to identify differentially expressed genes under two or more conditions. A number of computational tools , such as DESeq (Anders and Huber 2010) (updated as DESeq2 (Love, Huber et al. 2014)), edgeR (Robinson, McCarthy et al. 2010, Zhou, Lindsay et al. 2014), NOISeq (Tarazona, García-Alcalde et al. 2011), PoissonSeq (Li, Witten et al. 2011), and SAMseq (samr) (Li and Tibshirani 2013) and Cuffdiff (Trapnell, et al., 2013) have been developed for the analysis of differential gene expression from patterns in RNA-seq data. Most of these tools are implemented in R language, which is commonly used for the analysis of high-dimensional expression data. However, a fairly high level of programing skill is required when applying these R tools to screen out differentially expressed genes, greatly hindering the application of these tools since many biology researchers have little programing experience. Beyond this problem, due to a lack of an interactive interface in these tools, it is inconvenient to adjust the analytical parameters, even for advanced users. Moreover, since different packages generate inconsistent results, an interactive platform that combines these tools together is necessary for obtaining more solid analysis results. To address the above issues, here we introduce the Interactive Differential Expression Analyzer (IDEA), a Shiny-based web application dedicated to the identification of differential expression genes in an interactive way. IDEA was built as a user-friendly and highly interactive utility using the Shiny (RStudio Inc. 2014) package in R. Currently, five relevant R packages are integrated into IDEA.

Although massive acetylation sites have been identified through experimental identification and high-throughput proteomics techniques, their enzyme-specific regulation remains largely unknown. Here, we developed the deep learning-based protein lysine acetylation modification prediction (Deep-PLA) software for histone acetyltransferase (HAT)/histone deacetylase (HDAC)-specific acetylation prediction based on deep learning. Experimentally identified substrates and sites of several HATs and HDACs were curated from the literature to generate enzyme-specific data sets. We integrated various protein sequence features with deep neural network and optimized the hyperparameters with particle swarm optimization, which achieved satisfactory performance. Through comparisons based on cross-validations and testing data sets, the model outperformed previous studies. Meanwhile, we found that protein–protein interactions could enrich enzyme-specific acetylation regulatory relations and visualized this information in the Deep-PLA web server. Furthermore, a cross-cancer analysis of acetylation-associated mutations revealed that acetylation regulation was intensively disrupted by mutations in cancers and heavily implicated in the regulation of cancer signaling. These prediction and analysis results might provide helpful information to reveal the regulatory mechanism of protein acetylation in various biological processes to promote the research on prognosis and treatment of cancers.

However, there are few data about germline mutations of hereditary CRC-related genes in Chinese patients with CRC. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of gene mutations related to cancer susceptibility among Chinese patients with CRC, differences between Chinese and Western patients, and the phenotype-genotype correlation.\nMethods We retrospectively collected tumor samples from 526 patients with CRC under 70 years old who underwent hereditary CRC genetic testing. A series of bioinformatic analyses, as well as statistical comparisons, were performed.\nResults We found that 77 patients (14.6%) harbored functional variants of the 12 genes. The mutation frequencies of the top 5 mutated genes were 6.5% for MutL homolog 1 (MLH1), 5.1% for MutS homolog 2 (MSH2), 1.0% for MSH6, 0.8% for PMS1 homolog 2 (PMS2), and 0.8% for APC regulator of the WNT signaling pathway (APC). Our data showed much higher rates of mutations of MSH6 and PMS2 genes among all mismatch repair (MMR) genes as compared with those in Western populations. Mutations in MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 were found to be mutually exclusive. Patients with MLH1 or MSH2 mutations had higher frequencies of personal history of cancer (MLH1: 20.6% vs. 8.7%; MSH2: 25.9% vs. 8.6%) and family history of cancer than those without these mutations (MLH1: 73.5% vs. 48.4%; MSH2: 70.4% vs. 48.9%), and the lesions were more prone to occur on the right side of the colon than on the left side (MLH1: 73.5% vs. 29.3%; MSH2: 56.0% vs. 31.0%). The proportion of stage I/II disease was higher in patients with MLH1 mutations than in those without MLH1 mutations (70.6% vs. 50.7%), and the rate of polyps was higher in patients with APC mutations than in those with wild-type APC (75.0% vs. 17.4%).\nConclusion These results provide a full-scale landscape of hereditary susceptibility over 12 related genes in CRC patients and suggest that a comprehensive multi-gene panel testing for hereditary CRC predisposition could be a helpful analysis in clinical practice.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Germline mutational profile of Chinese patients under 70 years old with colorectal cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lei Miao","Xiao-Li Wei","Qi Zhao","JingJing Qi","Chao Ren","Qi-Nian Wu","Da-Liang Wei","Jia Liu","Feng-Hua Wang","Rui-Hua Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"bb61e6eefc47202d1ee128b13b128988","permalink":"https://likelet.github.io/publication/journal-article-p476s/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-p476s/","section":"publication","summary":"Objectives: Anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade represents the onset of a new era in cancer immunotherapy.

The expression of CD4, CD8, CD68, PD-L1, RBPJL and IL-16 was analysed by immunohistochemistry, and the correlation with prognostic value was obtained from the GEPIA portal. T-cell functions were examined by flow cytometry, MTS and transwell assays. The secreted cytokines were identified using an Inflammation Array Kit. The concentration of soluble IFN-γ was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The clinical benefit of RBPJL was examined in a PBMC xenograft mouse model.\nResults: The patient had an exceptional clinical response with shrinkage of the primary oesophageal and lung metastatic lesions as well as enlargement of liver metastatic lesions after toripalimab monotherapy. Four liver-specific gene mutations were identified. RBPJL showed better response to toripalimab in the PBMC cell-derived xenograft (CDX) ESCC model. Conditional medium from RBPJL overexpression induced chemotaxis and proliferation of T lymphocytes, as well as Th2/Th1 differentiation through the RBPJL-NF-κB-IL-16 axis in vitro.

Adaptation of cells to an acidic environment leads to the emergence of cancer stem cells. The expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is closely related to the initiation and development of colorectal carcinoma (CRC), but its regulatory mechanism in CRC stem cells is still unclear. Our study revealed that acidosis reduced VDR expression by downregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD) expression. Overexpression of VDR effectively suppressed the stemness and oxaliplatin resistance of cells in acidosis. The nuclear export signal in VDR was sensitive to acidosis, and VDR was exported from the nucleus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) analyses showed that VDR transcriptionally repressed SRY-box 2 (SOX2) by binding to the vitamin D response elements in the promoter of SOX2, impairing tumor growth and drug resistance. We demonstrated that a change in the acidic microenvironment combined with overexpression of VDR substantially restricted the occurrence and development of CRC in vivo. These findings reveal a new mechanism by which acidosis could affect the stemness of CRC cells by regulating the expression of SOX2 and show that abnormal VDR expression leads to ineffective activation of vitamin D signaling, resulting in a lack of efficacy of vitamin D in antineoplastic process.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"VDR–SOX2 signaling promotes colorectal cancer stemness and malignancy in an acidic microenvironment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yue Yang","Jieyun Zhang","Yanxing Chen","Ruihua Xu","Qi Zhao","Weijian Guo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"a431273d6625eca33aed235fcd1b4ca8","permalink":"https://likelet.github.io/publication/journal-article-muc4/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-muc4/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"MUC4, MUC16, and TTN genes mutation correlated with prognosis, and predicted tumor mutation burden and immunotherapy efficacy in gastric cancer and pan-cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zekun Liu","Qi Zhao","Zhixiang Zuo","Shuqiang Yuan","Kai Yu","Qingfeng Zhang","Xiaolong Zhang","Hui Sheng","Huaiqiang Ju","Han Cheng","others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"4c957e0480163a0f59441b084c9235b4","permalink":"https://likelet.github.io/publication/journal-article-systematic/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-systematic/","section":"publication","summary":"Ferroptosis is a type of cell death related to cancer; however, the characteristics of ferroptosis in cancers are still uncertain.

As the most frequently mutated gene in EBVnGC (62.7%), TP53 also displayed a mutation rate of 15.1% in EBVaGC. PIK3R1 was revealed as a novel mutated gene (11.0%) associated almost exclusively with EBVaGC. PIK3CA, SMAD4, PIK3R1, and BCOR were revealed to be unique driver genes in EBVaGC. ARID1A displayed a significantly large proportion of inactivated variants in EBVaGC. A notable finding was that integrating the EBV status with tumor mutation burden (TMB) and large genomic instability (LGI) categorized the tumors into four distinct molecular subtypes and optimally predicted patient prognosis. The corresponding median OSs for the EBV+/TMB‐high, EBV+/TMB‐low, EBV‐/LGI‐, and EBV‐/LGI+ subtypes were 96.2, 75.3, 44.4, and 20.2 months, respectively.

The clinical analysis also showed that high expression of these enzymes was associated with poor oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy outcomes in patients. Furthermore, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of CPT2 with perhexiline disturbed NADPH and redox homeostasis and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cell apoptosis in gastrointestinal cancer cells following oxaliplatin treatment. Specifically, the combination of oxaliplatin and perhexiline significantly suppressed the progression of gastrointestinal cancer in cell-based xenograft and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Mechanistically, CPT2 was transcriptionally upregulated by nuclear factor of activated T cells 3 (NFATc3), which translocated to the nucleus in response to oxaliplatin treatment.

This study aimed to identify a specific lncRNA that promotes the colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and could be a potential therapeutic target.\nMethods We screened highly expressed lncRNAs in human CRC samples compared with their matched adjacent normal tissues. The proteins that interact with LINRIS (Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA for IGF2BP2 Stability) were confirmed by RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. The proliferation and metabolic alteration of CRC cells with LINRIS inhibited were tested in vitro and in vivo.\nResults LINRIS was upregulated in CRC tissues from patients with poor overall survival (OS), and LINRIS inhibition led to the impaired CRC cell line growth. Moreover, knockdown of LINRIS resulted in a decreased level of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2), a newly found N6-methyladenosine (m6A) ‘reader’. LINRIS blocked K139 ubiquitination of IGF2BP2, maintaining its stability. This process prevented the degradation of IGF2BP2 through the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). Therefore, knockdown of LINRIS attenuated the downstream effects of IGF2BP2, especially MYC-mediated glycolysis in CRC cells. In addition, the transcription of LINRIS could be inhibited by GATA3 in CRC cells.

Besides, evidence suggests frameshift indels are a highly immunogenic mutational class and thus a potentially superior biomarker. However, the general prognostic impact of TMB and indel burden in patients with solid tumors has not been systematically investigated.\nMethods: We analyzed 20 primary solid cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Clinicopathologic factors, TMB and indel burden were collected or calculated. For each cancer type, the impact of TMB or indel burden on overall survival (OS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression with the method of inverse probability of treatment weighting.\nResults: Twenty cancer types from 6,035 patients were analyzed. Survival analysis showed that TMB had a significant impact on OS in 14 out of these 20 cancer types. According to the general survival impact of TMB, they could be classified into three groups, namely the TMB-Worse (eight cancer types), TMB-Better (six cancer types) and TMB-Similar (six cancer types) group, in which higher TMB was associated with inferior, superior, or similar OS, respectively. The survival impacts of TMB in the TMB-Worse and TMB-Better groups were generally consistent when limited to genes from two FDA-approved panels. Notably, in two out of the six cancer types in the TMB-Similar group, the indel burden significantly affected OS.\nConclusions: TMB, as well as indel burden, has divergent prognostic impact in different cancer types, thus could be incorporated in prognostication and risk stratification.

These results collectively indicate that cigarette smoke-induced miR-25-3p excessive maturation via m6A modification promotes the development and progression of pancreatic cancer.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Excessive miR-25-3p maturation via N6-methyladenosine stimulated by cigarette smoke promotes pancreatic cancer progression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Feng Wang","Chao Ren","Qi Zhao","Nong Xu","Lin Shen","Guanghai Dai","Xianglin Yuan","Ye Chen","Shujun Yang","Jianhua Shi","others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"ed8fbacbeaaeb7a9f034ca9032070d4c","permalink":"https://likelet.github.io/publication/conference-paper-association/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper-association/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Association of frequent amplification of chromosome 11q13 in esophageal squamous cell cancer with clinical benefit to immune check point blockade","type":"publication"},{"authors":["De-Shen Wang","Ze-Xian Liu","Yun-Xin Lu","Hua Bao","Xue Wu","Zhao-Lei Zeng","Zekun Liu","Qi Zhao","Cai-Yun He","Jia-Huan Lu","others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"0e311c9967d2c2b5ea053f963a6d9529","permalink":"https://likelet.github.io/publication/journal-article-liquid/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-liquid/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective To monitor trastuzumab resistance and determine the underlying mechanisms for the limited response rate and rapid emergence of resistance of HER2+ metastatic gastric cancer (mGC).\nDesign Targeted sequencing of 416 clinically relevant genes was performed in 78 paired plasma and tissue biopsy samples to determine plasma-tissue concordance.

Although the importance of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in cancer has been increasingly recognized, few studies have been explored the functional mechanism of piRNAs in breast cancer development and progression.\nMethods We examined the top 20 highly expressed piRNAs based on the analysis of TCGA breast cancer data in two patient cohorts to test the roles of piRNAs in breast cancer. The effects of piRNA-36,712 on the malignant phenotypes and chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells were detected in vitro and in vivo. MS2-RIP and reporter gene assays were conducted to identify the interaction and regulation among piRNA-36,712, miRNAs and SEPW1P. Kaplan-Meier estimate with log-rank test was used to compare patient survival by different piRNA-36,712 expression levels.\nResults We found piRNA-36,712 level was significantly lower in breast cancer than in normal breast tissues and low level was correlated with poor clinical outcome in patients. Functional studies demonstrated that piRNA-36,712 interacts with RNAs produced by SEPW1P, a retroprocessed pseudogene of SEPW1, and subsequently inhibits SEPW1 expression through competition of SEPW1 mRNA with SEPW1P RNA for microRNA-7 and microRNA-324. We also found that higher SEPW1 expression due to downregulation of piRNA-36,712 in breast cancer may suppress P53, leading to the upregulated Slug but decreased P21 and E-cadherin levels, thus promoting cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Furthermore, we found that piRNA-36,712 had synergistic anticancer effects with the paclitaxel and doxorubicin, two chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer.\nConclusions These findings suggest that piRNA-36,712 is a novel tumor suppressor and may serve as a potential predictor for the prognosis of breast cancer patients.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"PIWI-interacting RNA-36712 restrains breast cancer progression and chemoresistance by interaction with SEPW1 pseudogene SEPW1P RNA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kai Yu","Qingfeng Zhang","Zekun Liu","Qi Zhao","Xiaolong Zhang","Yan Wang","Zi-Xian Wang","Ying Jin","Xiaoxing Li","Ze-Xian Liu","Rui-Hua Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"43d1d9166e23f3910b59faaf16cde3ea","permalink":"https://likelet.github.io/publication/journal-article-qphos/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-qphos/","section":"publication","summary":"Temporal and spatial protein phosphorylation dynamically orchestrates a broad spectrum of biological processes and plays various physiological and pathological roles in diseases and cancers.

Generally, circadian rhythm was proposed to play important roles in tumor suppression, while there were also evidences that disruption of canonical circadian pathway have anti-cancer effects. In this study, we systematically analyzed the aberrances including mutation, somatic copy number alternation, differential DNA methylation and differential expression of circadian genes across cancers based on TCGA data. It is observed that core circadian network genes (CCNGs) such as PER1/2/3, CLOCK, CRY1/2, ARNTL were highly mutated in a number of cancers such as uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, stomach adenocarcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma. Generally, the expression for the majority of CCNGs was down regulated in a variety of the cancers such as bladder urothelial carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, cervical and endocervical cancers, prostate adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme and stomach adenocarcinoma, while the expression of a number of CCNGs were related with overall survival in various cancers. The alternations of somatic copy number and DNA methylation were observed to be consistent with the differential expression of these CCNGs. Furthermore, the PCA based circadian gene expression signature was found to be related with the overall survivals and immunophenotypes among cancers, which indicated that circadian rhythm might play critical roles in regulation of immune signaling state in tumor environment.

In this study, we show that UHRF1 is highly expressed in retinoblastoma, and genomes of human primary retinoblastoma and cell lines have differential DNA methylation patterns compared with those of normal retina, characterized by lower global methylation and higher promoter methylation of tumor suppressors. However, our genome-wide DNA methylation study uncovers that UHRF1 down-modulation in retinoblastoma cells exerts minor effects on the existing methylation patterns at both bulk genome and individual gene loci, suggesting that retinoblastoma methylome is primarily maintained by other mechanisms. Furthermore, using two murine retinoblastoma models, we found that high UHRF1 expression does not alter global methylation levels in both premalignant neonatal retina and retinoblastoma tumors, implying that DNA hypomethylation may not be an early mechanism driving retinoblastoma tumorigenesis unlike what has been proposed for other types of cancer. These results suggest that tumor-promoting functions of UHRF1 in retinoblastoma are largely independent of its role in DNA methylation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Functional dissection of the role of UHRF1 in the regulation of retinoblastoma methylome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinwen Feng","Chen Ding","Naiqi Qiu","Xiaotian Ni","Dongdong Zhan","Wanlin Liu","Xia Xia","Peng Li","Bingxin Lu","Qi Zhao","others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"8836d830acfa8e19dfbb5ebc5618b68b","permalink":"https://likelet.github.io/publication/journal-article-firmiana/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-firmiana/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Firmiana: towards a one-stop proteomic cloud platform for data processing and analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yubin Xie","Xiaotong Luo","Zhihao He","Yueyuan Zheng","Zhixiang Zuo","Qi Zhao","Yanyan Miao","Jian Ren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"5f2cedf5844cba40ee6f29af7be2404c","permalink":"https://likelet.github.io/publication/journal-article-virusmap/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-virusmap/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"VirusMap: A visualization database for the influenza A virus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qingbin Zhang","Li Chen","Shiman Cui","Yan Li","Qi Zhao","Wei Cao","Shixiang Lai","Sanjun Yin","Zhixiang Zuo","Jian Ren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"290494be9707d56b3b6bc16be90ca919","permalink":"https://likelet.github.io/publication/journal-article-expression/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-expression/","section":"publication","summary":"Although long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been emerging as critical regulators in various tissues and biological processes, little is known about their expression and regulation during the osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) in inflammatory microenvironment.

Moreover, we have identified 650 differentially expressed lncRNAs among different subsets of PDLSCs. Pathway enrichment analysis for neighboring protein-coding genes of these differentially expressed lncRNAs revealed stem cell differentiation related functions.

Accumulated evidence indicates that hTERT may have noncanonical functions beyond telomerase by regulating the expression of particular genes. However, comprehensive identification of the genes regulated by hTERT is unavailable. In this report, we expressed WT hTERT and hTERTmut which displays dysfunctional catalytic activity, in human U2OS cancer cells and VA-13 immortalized fibroblast cells, both of which lack endogenous hTERT and hTR expression. Changes in gene expression induced by hTERT and hTERT-mut expression were determined by genome-wide RNA-seq and verified by qPCR. Our results showed that hTERT affects different genes in two cell lines, implying that the regulation of gene expression by hTERT is indirect and cell type dependent. Moreover, functional analysis identifies cell adhesion-related genes that have been changed by hTERT in both cell lines. Adhesion experiments revealed that hTERT expression significantly increases cell adhesion. Monolayer wound healing and transwell assays demonstrated increased cell migration upon hTERT expression.

This model predicts significant changes in fluxes of certain sphingolipid species after SA treatment, changes that likely trigger downstream physiological and phenotypic effects. To validate the simulation, we used 15N-labeled metabolic turnover analysis to measure sphingolipid contents and turnover rate in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with SA or the SA analog benzothiadiazole (BTH). The results show that both SA and BTH affect sphingolipid metabolism, altering the concentrations of certain species and also changing the optimal flux distribution and turnover rate of sphingolipids.
